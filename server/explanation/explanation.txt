server structure 

    Database:
        - defines models (data collections) to be displayed in the Database
        - connects server with MongoDB
    Graphql: supports type-defined data
        - TypeDefs:
            - defines types of data (has to be matched with data collections in the Database)
            - defines all actions to do with data (Query, Mutation)
            - Query => Read data (without changing data)
            - Mutation => change data (add, update, delete)
        - Resolvers:
            - let the servers know what they have to do with all the queries and mutations
            - (how the servers would react to every queries and mutations)


Difference between Rest API with Graphql
data: 
{
    a: 1
    b: 2
    c: 3
    d: 4
}

Rest API => when request data => return everything
Graphql => when request data => return only data we need => avoid overfetching or underfetching data

Rest API => multiple endpoints
Graphql => all requests are combined into 1 single endpoint
